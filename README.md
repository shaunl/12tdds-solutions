PHP Solutions for the 12 TDD's of Christmas

These are my solutions. There are other ways to complete these katas and you should only use these as a reference
after you have completed the katas yourself.

A big thank you to John Cleary for the katas! 

All katas can be found at [http://www.wiredtothemoon.com/](http://www.wiredtothemoon.com/)
